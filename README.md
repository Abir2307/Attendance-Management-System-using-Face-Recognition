Overview:
The Face Recognition Attendance System is an automated solution for recording attendance using facial recognition technology. 
It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and recognize faces, ensuring an efficient and contactless way to track attendance.

Features:
Real-time Face Detection: Detects faces from a live webcam feed.
Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a pre-registered database.
Attendance Logging: Automatically records attendance with timestamps in the database.
Database Management: Handles student details and attendance records efficiently.
User-Friendly Interface: Simplified GUI for interaction and management.

Technologies Used-
Programming Language:
Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
OpenCV: For face detection and recognition.
NumPy: For numerical computations,to convert image to NumPy array.
Tkinter: For GUI development.
MySQL: For database management.
PIL: For preprocessing image (converting image to grayscale)
